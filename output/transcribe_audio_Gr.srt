1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
The Erdbeben in Hihiti.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:07,060
The Erdbeben in Hihiti was a black Erdbeben,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,100
which was in 2012, in 2016,

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,780
and was in the same age as the old age.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,940
The center of the Latin American state bridge bridge.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,540
The StÃ¤rke of Erdbeben's Erdbeben is located 7.0 on the right of the scale.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:29,900
After the research of the region, the Erdbeben is located at 200,000 people.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
Many more are open and relaxed.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,320
The Erdbeben is located at the highest level of the Erdbeben in the region,

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,160
which is more than 200 years old.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,800
There are many times more and more plundering.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,800
The country is trying to get out.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,960
Many countries try to help Hiti and find her very well.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,960
We have many more cities and techniques and have to help her.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,000
It is very difficult now to help her.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,800
I think it is better if it is not a long time ago,

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,660
how Hiti would go.

18
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,700
People are very happy.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,940
But we are very good here and we are very happy to change this area.
