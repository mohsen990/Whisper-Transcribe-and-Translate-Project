00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,600
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,000
Today we're bringing you part two of another great lesson that we had.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes. New guy in town.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
New guy in town.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Part two.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Part two.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Kind of a creepy story.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, and this one is also a little bit strange, a little bit weird.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, unusual outcome.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Unusual ending.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But it has to do a lot with invitations.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right. So an invitation is when you ask somebody to do something with you.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Right.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A dinner invitation.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So we're going to be talking about invitations and inviting people to do things.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well with that, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Don't you think so, Ellen?

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, yes, yes, of course. We'd love to come over.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Can I bring anything?

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of everything.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll see you tonight, come with an appetite.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I know what I will.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner. He gives me the creeps.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why in earth did you accept?

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, come on, Ellen. It'll be nice to get to know him besides.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He's new to the neighborhood and will be rude to decline his invitation.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I guess so. You always wrote me into things like this.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ladies.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you for coming. You look delicious. I mean, beautiful. Please come in.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, Armand, you're too kind. How did I get myself into this?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm really anxious to see what happens in this dinner party.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, I guess we'll have to stay tuned and find out for part three.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah. All right. Well, we have some really great vocabulary.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So I guess we can start with language takeaway.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Language takeaway.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Language takeaway.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think we can start with language takeaway.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Language takeaway.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All right. On language takeaway today, we have three great words.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Erica, why don't you start us off with the first one?

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The first word is thoughtful.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thoughtful. Thoughtful.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thoughtful. So when you're thoughtful, you're kind, right?

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're kind. You consider it to other people.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You think about what the other person would like.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Right. And you do that thing.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's so thoughtful of you.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Our second phrase. Give me the creeps.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Give me the creeps.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Give me the creeps.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is kind of a funny phrase, but I think if we listen to some examples, we'll understand the meaning.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Example one.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Horror movie's giving me the creeps.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Example two.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Stop it. You're giving me the creeps.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Example three.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So I can see this one means to make me feel uncomfortable.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Right. It makes me feel scared.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Like scared.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, scared.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It gives me the creeps.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And our last phrase for language takeaway.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Rope me into.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Rope me into something.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Rope me into something.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So if you rope me into something, it's.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's like you convince me to do something that I don't really want to do.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right. So I roped you into lending me your car.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That was a bad idea.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That was a bad idea.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And you wrote me into going out for beers afterwards.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah. That was a great idea.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All right. So rope me into convinced.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
All righty. So I guess we could listen to our dialogue again.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This time a little bit slower and you'll be able to understand the language a little bit more clearly.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh Armand.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't you think so, Ellen?

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, yes, of course.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We'd love to come over.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Can I bring anything?

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, don't worry about it.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll take care of everything.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll see you tonight.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come with an appetite.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I know I will.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He gives me the creeps.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why on earth did you accept?

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, come on, Ellen.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It will be nice to get to know him.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And it will be rude to decline his invitation.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I guess so.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You always wrote me into things like this.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Ladies.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you for coming.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You look delicious.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I mean, beautiful.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Please come in.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Come in.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, Armand.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You are too kind.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How did I get myself into this?

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, I guess that's a lot more clear.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And with that, we can start putting it together today.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Putting it together.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Today, we've got three words and phrases that we want to show you how you can put together

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and use differently.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The first one is appetite.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Appetite.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Appetite.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So appetite is like a strong desire for food, right?

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Right.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
An appetite.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We've got some examples that show you how to use this phrase.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's listen.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Example 1.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mmm, dinner smells so good.

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's giving me an appetite.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Example 2.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're sure eating a lot.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You must have a big appetite.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Example 3.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm getting sick.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Have a fever and I've lost my appetite.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, so we saw some great examples of appetite.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You can lose your appetite.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's right.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You have a big appetite.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A small appetite.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
A healthy appetite.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Right.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So it just means...

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A desire for food.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A hunger for food.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Great.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What's our second phrase for today?

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Get to know someone.

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Get to know.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Get to know.

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So when you get to know someone is you talk to them and you find out what they do.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, you get more familiar with that.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
More familiar, right?

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Mmm.

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
For example, we can say I got to know her in Spanish class and she's a really nice person.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Or you can say our mom, Ellen and Doris got to know each other at a dinner party.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Right.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Or you can say if you get to know me, you'll see that I'm not a bad guy.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's true.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Get to know.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And our third phrase is, why on earth?

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why on earth?

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why on earth?

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why on earth?

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is like a saying expression.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
You can use it in a lot of different ways.

174
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,600
So we've got some examples for you.

175
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Let's listen.

176
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Example 1.

177
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:14,760
Where on earth is my phone?

178
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Example 2.

179
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,760
How on earth did you learn English in one month?

180
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Example 3.

181
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:35,600
What on earth is it?

182
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,400
So when you ask a question with on earth, so why on earth?

183
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
How on earth?

184
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
What on earth?

185
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,600
It's like you're showing a lot of surprise.

186
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Okay.

187
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Great stuff.

188
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Let's listen to our dialogue a third time.

189
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:55,320
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

190
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,880
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

191
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Don't you think so, Ellen?

192
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,280
Oh, yes, of course.

193
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,800
We'd love to come over.

194
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Can I bring anything?

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
No.

196
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Don't worry about it.

197
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I'll take care of everything.

198
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,640
I'll see you tonight.

199
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Come with an appetite.

200
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I know I will.

201
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:22,160
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

202
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,960
He gives me the creeps.

203
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,760
Why on earth did you accept?

204
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Well, come on, Ellen.

205
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,600
It'll be nice to get to know him besides.

206
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,120
He's new to the neighborhood, and it'll be rude to decline his invitation.

207
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
I guess so.

208
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,760
You always wrote me into things like this.

209
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Ladies.

210
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,400
Thank you for coming.

211
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,040
You look delicious.

212
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,520
I mean, beautiful.

213
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,560
Please come in.

214
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,360
Oh, Armand, you are too kind.

215
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,720
How did I get myself into this?

216
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,720
I'm going to be a little bit more honest.

217
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm going to be a little bit more honest.

218
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,960
We want to know what you think happens next.

219
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Yes.

220
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,360
What happens in this dialogue next?

221
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,320
So we want you to send us your idea of what happens next, and we're going to choose

222
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
the best one.

223
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
That's right.

224
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Marco and I will choose the best continuation of this story, and we'll use that in part

225
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,680
three of the new guy in town.

226
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
That's right.

227
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
You can give it any direction you want.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's right.

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,320
Of course, we'll publish the name of the author with the lesson.

230
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Yes.

231
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm really anxious to see what ideas come up and how we can end this dialogue.

232
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
I know.

233
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,080
We've got a lot of really creative users out there, so I'm really looking forward to this.

234
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
That's right.

235
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
That's right.

236
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,320
So be sure to send us your ideas, either a private message, or you can post it on the

237
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,960
comments section of this lesson.

238
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,400
Any other questions or doubts?

239
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,280
Go to EnglishPod.com and you can leave them there.

240
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Yes.

241
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,520
Marco and I are always happy to answer your questions.

242
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Okay, folks.

243
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,800
Until then, it's goodbye.

244
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Goodbye.
