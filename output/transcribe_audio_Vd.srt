00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This short video highlights features of Envivo Qualitative Data Analysis Software.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Envivo is an analysis software for coding or tagging qualitative data with themes or codes.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Qualitative researchers are often analyzing text-based sources,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and listed here are some examples of text-based sources that Envivo can be used to analyze.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It can also be used to analyze audio-visual materials such as these listed below.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So Donia describes a code as a short word or phrase that symbolically assigns a summative, salient, essence capturing,

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and or evocative attribute for a portion of language-based or visual data.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In Envivo, you use the node feature to create codes.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This excerpt from a coding overview video notes that coding is both a means of dividing your data into manageable segments,

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
as well as a means of allowing you quick access to the relevant data when you need it.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I drew the red boxes around manageable and quick access,

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
because I think that's what researchers want most out of using a qualitative data analysis software.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
To make the coding process manageable,

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and to facilitate quick access to their data.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So if you think about manually coding textual data, this is what that might look like.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You pronounce the data, read it, and then underline relevant passages of text,

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and then code or tag them with a theme by writing the codes in the margins.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And this might be fairly manageable and allow you quick access to your data if you have smaller projects.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But as projects grow or the complexity of your coding increases,

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you might find yourself graduating to trying to use different colors of highlighters for different codes.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But then you run out of colors, or you soak your paper with wet highlighter,

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and how do you manage one passage of text that you want to code at multiple codes?

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Or you decide you'll have different colors of Post-it notes for each node,

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
to stick on your piles of paper.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Again, finite colors may become a problem.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And what if one falls off on the floor and you don't remember where it goes?

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And before you know it, you're feeling a little like this.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And what's happened to make your data analysis manageable and allowing quick access to your data?

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is where using an analysis software like Envivo begins to look very appealing.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to use some screenshots from Envivo to demonstrate the utility of using a qualitative data analysis software.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
First, you have one Envivo project file into which you import all of your separate data source files.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
To open a data source, you just double-click it.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then you can start reading your data and highlight an interesting or relevant passage of text.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Right-click it and select code.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Then either code it at one or more few nodes you previously created or code it at a brand new node.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And this is pretty much analogous to the process of manually coding.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In other words, Envivo is not reading your data and doing the coding for you.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You still have to read your data and use your research questions or analytical framework to guide what segments of the data are relevant and should be.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:11,000
As you do your coding, you are developing a coding scheme or coding tree that reflects the codes or theme nodes you've created and coded for,

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:26,000
but also represents how many data files you've coded at a given node and how many individual passages of text or references in Envivo that you've coded at that given node.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
For example, for the node of no limits to access to information, I coded 11 of my total 12 data sources at least once at that code.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And I coded 75 individual segments of text within those 11 sources at that code.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then if I want to see the 75 individual segments of text, I can just double-click on the node to open a brief view of those individual passages of text.

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This view shows me the individual passages of text divided out by the data source.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So I can see for student 1, ID as S1, I coded 5 passages of text at the theme node of no limits to access to information.

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And if I want to see the passages of text within the context of the source, I can click the hot linked source title.

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It opens the source and highlights the passages of text that I coded at no limits to access to information.

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And if I turn the coding stripes feature on, I can also see that some of those passages of text were coded at other nodes, such as social justice.

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:01,000
These features alone demonstrate how Envivo makes coding and analyzing, qualitative data, much more manageable, and facilitates quick access to the relevant data.

50
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And there's so much more.

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:15,000
For example, you can use word frequency queries to explore the data and generate word cloud visualizations for use in presentations or publications.

52
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can create other visualizations, such as comparison diagrams, to visually explore convergence and divergence in your data sources or coding themes.

53
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And you can define attributes about your data sources and then do comparisons of your coding to examine relationships and patterns by these attributes, for example using the cross tabs query feature pictured here.

54
00:06:44,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In conclusion, these features and others in Envivo qualitative data analysis software can help qualitative researchers be more organized, efficient, and thorough in their analyses and also help them document their analysis process for transparency and replication purposes in ways that manual analyses tend to fall short.
